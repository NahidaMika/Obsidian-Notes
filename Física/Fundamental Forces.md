## Fundamental Forces
- ***Gravitational force***:
	 - An attractive force between any two objects with mass. It is the weakest of the four forces but operates over infinite distances and is responsible for the structure of the universe. It is also the attractive force which arises from the gravitational interaction. When considered for massive objects, like the sun, or giant planets, gravitational force is considered to be strong as the masses of these objects are also large. On an atomic level, this force is considered weak. 
	$$F_{g} = \frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}} $$
	where,
	
	- Fg is the gravitational force
	- G is the universal gravitational constant
	- m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects in consideration
	- r is the distance between the centers of the two objects in consideration

- ***Electromagnetic force***.
	- Acts on electrically charged particles. It includes both electric and magnetic forces and is responsible for holding atoms and molecules together. Forces like friction and tension are derived from it. By their nature, all particles are only attracted to particles that have an opposite charge and repel those with like charges. These have a long-range and the effect of their forces diminishes over distance due to the shielding effect. However, sub-atomically, they have short-range and are considered strong forces but still weaker than strong nuclear forces.

- ***Strong nuclear force***.
	- Electromagnetism holds matter together, but there was no explanation on how the nucleus is held together in the atom. If we consider only electromagnetism and gravity, then the nucleus should actually fly off in different directions. But it doesnâ€™t, implying that there exists another force within the nucleus which is stronger than the gravitational force and electromagnetic force. This is where nuclear forces come into play. Strong nuclear forces are responsible for holding the nuclei of atoms together.

- ***Weak nuclear force***.
	- A short-range force responsible for certain types of radioactive decay, specifically the beta decay neutrino interactions. It has a very short range (less than 1 fm) and this force is, as the name suggests, weak in nature.
