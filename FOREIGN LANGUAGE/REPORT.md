Betel de la Fuente held a talk called _“Noviazgo sin violencia”_ on Wednesday, October 15, at the Instituto de Lenguas Extranjeras, dedicated to exploring what constitutes a **healthy relationship**.

The session primarily served as a guide for recognizing **non-obvious emotional and psychological violence**. Betel explained that seemingly minor actions like **ghosting, love bombing, and gaslighting** are powerful tools of manipulation and could be harmful. She emphasize that **controlling behavior**—like monitoring a partner's phone or deciding their social life—should never be mistaken for love; these are actually serious warning signs. 

The presentation concluded with a strong call for relationships to be built on a foundation of **respect, trust, and transparent communication**, highlighting that knowing these toxic patterns is essential for setting **boundaries** and supporting a respectful environment for everyone.

In my personal opinion I agree that relationships are built specially on trust and respect, also the communication is an essential aspect of a good relationship, because if there's a problem it should be solved by talking and not my any other means.
